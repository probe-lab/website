# About this Website

This is the space where the ProbeLab team presents results from its measurement and monitoring studies across various Web3.0 and blockchain networks. The site, as well as the infrastructure and scripts used to produce the plots are maintained by the ProbeLab team.

The results presented here give an accurate view of the high-level protocol operation and occasionally dive into protocol specific parameters that are primarily of interest to protocol designers and engineers. What is different about this website is that it is not a “raw” dashboard, but instead includes description of the experiments we’re carrying out in order to produce the results. This helps engineers and protocol designers understand accurately the methodology of the experiments, as well as the results presented.

We do not provide commentary on the results presented on this website. Instead, discussion around results reported here is taking place at the respective community forums of the networks we're monitoring.
