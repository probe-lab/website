# Introduction

The Protocol Benchmarking & Optimization Team (ProbeLab) is on a mission to measure the performance of Web3.0 network protocols, benchmark protocols against target performance milestones and propose improvements to their core design principles.

We focus on understanding the mechanics of internal network protocols, as well as how they interact with other parts of the system. Our expertise lies in network-layer protocols, and we are particularly active in the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io) space, though our work is not limited to that. We dive deep into the protocol as an independent entity and investigate the exogenous factors that influence its performance.

Our team specializes in cross-protocol interoperation and network architecture, works to identify potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the system and provide solutions, accordingly.
