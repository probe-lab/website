# Ethereum discv5 weekly report 2024-09

Our methodology is available [here](../methodology).

## Agents

### Agent Distribution

{{< plotly json="../../plots/2024/02/26/discv5-agents-overall.json" height="600px" >}}

This bar chart represents the distribution of various user agents within the Ethereum `discv5` DHT. Each bar corresponds to a different user agent or client type and indicates its relative prevalence within the network for the given reporting period. The chart provides a snapshot of how different Ethereum clients are being utilized in the network's decentralized infrastructure.

{{< plotly json="../../plots/2024/02/26/discv5-agents-versions.json" height="600px" >}}

This chart presents the version distribution for all major user agents, with each bar representing the average number of online peers over the course of a week.

{{< plotly json="../../plots/2024/02/26/discv5-versions-distribution.json" height="600px" >}}

This stacked chart illustrates how the distribution of agent versions for all key user agents evolves over time. It offers insights into the uptake of newer versions among these agents.

## Geolocation

Geographical data is sourced from the [MaxMind database](https://www.maxmind.com), which maps IP addresses to corresponding countries.

This bar plot illustrates the distribution of observed beacon nodes across different countries.

{{< plotly json="../../plots/2024/02/26/discv5-geo-agents-bars.json" height="600px" >}}

This bar plot illustrates the distribution of observed beacon nodes across different countries, broken down for each major user agent. 

{{< plotly json="../../plots/2024/02/26/discv5-geo-agent-All-lines.json" height="600px" >}}

This plot displays the weekly geographical distribution of beacon nodes, categorized by country.

{{< plotly json="../../plots/2024/02/26/discv5-geo-agents-lines.json" height="600px" >}}

This plot displays the weekly geographical distribution categorized by country, for each major user agent.

## Cloud Providers

Cloud providers data is sourced from [Udger](https://udger.com/resources/datacenter-list), which maps IP addresses to known hosting providers.

### Cloud Hosting Rate

{{< plotly json="../../plots/2024/02/26/discv5-cloud-rate-agent-All-lines.json" height="600px" >}}

This line chart displays the count of beacon nodes within the Ethereum discv5 network that are hosted on known commercial cloud providers, compared to those that are not. It tracks the distribution over a specified period, offering insights into the infrastructure preferences for node hosting.

Regular analysis of this chart can reveal trends in the adoption of cloud services for beacon nodes. Such information is crucial for understanding the network's resilience and the potential reliance on cloud infrastructure.
cloud-rate-agents

{{< plotly json="../../plots/2024/02/26/discv5-cloud-rate-agents.json" height="600px" >}}

This line chart illustrates the number of beacon nodes within the Ethereum discv5 network, hosted by recognized commercial cloud providers, broken down by each major user agent. It provides a user agent-specific view, mirroring the approach of the previously mentioned analysis, to highlight hosting preferences across different user agents.

{{< plotly json="../../plots/2024/02/26/discv5-cloud-agent-All-bars.json" height="600px" >}}

This bar chart presents the weekly distribution of Ethereum beacon nodes among various cloud providers, including nodes not hosted within data centers.

{{< plotly json="../../plots/2024/02/26/discv5-cloud-agents-bars.json" height="600px" >}}

This bar chart showcases the weekly distribution of Ethereum beacon nodes across different cloud providers, broken down for each major user agent.

{{< plotly json="../../plots/2024/02/26/discv5-cloud-agent-All-lines.json" height="600px" >}}

The line chart illustrates the trends in the distribution of Ethereum beacon nodes across cloud providers over the given time period. Note that nodes hosted outside of data centers are not included in this representation.

## Stale Records

{{< plotly json="../../plots/2024/02/26/discv5-stale-records-stacked.json" height="600px" >}}

This stacked plot depicts the count of peer records stored within each node's routing table and made accessible through the DHT. These peer records serve as a mechanism through which nodes gain knowledge about new remote nodes in the network.

Ensuring the reachability of referenced nodes shared within the network holds paramount importance. The plot delineates the occurrences of reachable and non-reachable (stale) peer records.

For instance, if a node's reference is present in the routing tables of 100 other nodes and the node is reachable, the plot will reflect an increase of 100 in the _online_ category.


## Protocols

{{< plotly json="../../plots/2024/02/26/discv5-crawl-protocols.json" height="1200px" >}}

This plot illustrates the evolving count of nodes endorsing each of the prevailing protocols over time. It exclusively presents data gathered from nodes accessible through a libp2p connection via our crawler. The identification of supported protocols relies on the libp2p identify protocol, hence necessitating a libp2p connection for discovery.
