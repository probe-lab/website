# Ethereum discv5 weekly report 2025-19

The following results show measurement data that were collected in **calendar week** 19 **of** 2025 from `2025-05-05` to `2025-05-12`.

Our methodology is available [here](../methodology). Note we are only able to display information about dialable nodes, hence nodes operating behind a NAT aren't accounted for, even though they may be connected.

## Agents

### Agent Distribution

This bar chart represents the distribution of various user agents within the Ethereum Mainnet `discv5` DHT. Each bar corresponds to a different user agent or client type and indicates its relative prevalence within the network for the given reporting period. The chart provides a snapshot of how different Ethereum Mainnet clients are being utilized in the network's decentralized infrastructure.

The bar labeled `Unknown` represents the count of nodes that we confirmed to be online but couldn't retrieve the agent version information from. This situation can occur due to various reasons, such as the node terminating the connection before completing the full protocol negotiation. In this case, despite reaching an advanced stage in the process, we were unable to obtain any information about the node's configuration.

## Protocols

This plot illustrates the evolving count of nodes supporting each of the listed protocols over time for the different user agents. The identification of supported protocols relies on the [libp2p identify protocol]&#40;https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/identify&#41;.

## Quic support

This stacked chart illustrates `quic` support for Ethereum beacon nodes over time, broken down by user agent.

## Geolocation

Geographical data is sourced from a leading IP Geolocation provider, which maps IP addresses to corresponding countries.


This bar plot illustrates the distribution of observed beacon nodes across different countries, broken down for each major user agent.

## Cloud Providers

This pie chart shows the average number of nodes over a day hosted on known cloud providers, compared to those that are not. 

Cloud providers data is powered by [ipregistry.co](https://ipregistry.co), which maps IP addresses to known hosting providers.

### Cloud Hosting Rate

This line chart displays the count of beacon nodes within the Ethereum Mainnet network that are hosted on known commercial cloud providers, compared to those that are not. It tracks the distribution over a specified period, offering insights into the infrastructure preferences for node hosting. The graph is broken down by each major user agent.

Regular analysis of this chart can reveal trends in the adoption of cloud services for beacon nodes. Such information is crucial for understanding the network's resilience and the potential reliance on cloud infrastructure.

### Cloud Provider Dependence

This bar chart presents the distribution of Ethereum Mainnet nodes among various cloud providers, including nodes not hosted within data centers (grouped under Non-Cloud).

{{< plotly json="https://cdn.probelab.io/plots/ethereum_mainnet/2025/05/11/cloud_provider_avg_1d_plot.json" height="600px" >}}

This chart illustrates the trends in the distribution of all Ethereum Mainnet beacon nodes across cloud providers over the given time period. Nodes that cannot be classified with a cloud provider is labelled as "Non-
Cloud". Note that nodes hosted outside of data centers are not included in this representation.

## Forks

### Current Forks

The following graph shows the currently advertised fork digests by different agents. This indicates which chain forks the network is following.

### Next Forks

The following graph shows the advertised next forks that the nodes intend to follow at a certain future epoch.

## Stale Node Records

### All `discv5` peers

This stacked plot depicts the count of node records stored within each node's routing table and made accessible through the DHT. These node records serve as a mechanism through which nodes discover new remote nodes in the network.

Ensuring the reachability of referenced nodes shared within the network holds paramount importance. The plot delineates the occurrences of reachable and non-reachable (stale) node records. Note that nodes running behind a NAT are counted as unreachable even though they may be online.

For instance, if a node's record is present in the routing tables of 100 other nodes and the node is reachable, the plot will reflect an increase of 100 in the _online_ category.

This plot displays data about all nodes participating in `discv5` and isn't limited to Ethereum mainnet nodes.

### Ethereum mainnet

This plot is similar to the above but only displays the number of Ethereum mainnet () records found in the routing table of other Ethereum mainnet () nodes.

## Sample Size

The following numbers show the sample size and other general statistics during the measurement period

- **Number of crawls: `83`**
  
  The number of crawls executed during the week indicated above.

- **Number of visits: `3433597`**

  Every attempt to dial or connect to a peer counts as a visit. Regardless of errors that may occur. We visit peers many times during a given week to extract information from them or probe for their uptime. We visit all peers that we discover in the DHT and peers that we found to be still online from the previous week.

- **Number of unique addresses discovered in the DHT: `49814`**

  The total number of unique IP:Port combinations that our crawler learned about from other peers over the period of the given week and attempted to dial or connect to (visit). This is not the total number of Peer IDs that existed simultaneously in the network at any point during the week. It is the aggregate over the entire week.

- **Analysed fork digests:**

  | Fork Digest | Name |
  |------------|------|
  | 0xafcaaba0 | Altair |
  | 0x4a26c58b | Bellatrix |
  | 0xbba4da96 | Capella |
  | 0x6a95a1a9 | Deneb |
  | 0xad532ceb | Electra |

  Only nodes that advertised the above Gnosis mainnet fork digests were considered in this analysis.

Timestamps are in UTC if not mentioned otherwise.
