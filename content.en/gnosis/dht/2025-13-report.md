# Gnosis discv5 weekly report 2025-13

The following results show measurement data that were collected in **calendar week** 13 **of** 2025 from `2025-03-24` to `2025-03-31`.

Our methodology is available [here](../methodology). Note we are only able to display information about dialable nodes, hence nodes operating behind a NAT aren't accounted for, even though they may be connected.

- **Number of crawls: `84`**
  
  The number of crawls executed during the week indicated above.

- **Number of visits: `151495`**

  Every attempt to dial or connect to a peer counts as a visit. Regardless of errors that may occur. We visit peers many times during a given week to extract information from them or probe for their uptime. We visit all peers that we discover in the DHT and peers that we found to be still online from the previous week.

- **Number of unique addresses discovered in the DHT: `3438`**

  The total number of unique IP:Port combinations that our crawler learned about from other peers over the period of the given week and attempted to dial or connect to (visit). This is not the total number of Peer IDs that existed simultaneously in the network at any point during the week. It is the aggregate over the entire week.

- **Analysed fork digest: `0x3ebfd484`**
  
  Only nodes that advertised the above fork digest were considered in this analysis.

Timestamps are in UTC if not mentioned otherwise.

## Agents

### Agent Distribution

This bar chart represents the distribution of various user agents within the Gnosis `discv5` DHT. Each bar corresponds to a different user agent or client type and indicates its relative prevalence within the network for the given reporting period. The chart provides a snapshot of how different Gnosis clients are being utilized in the network's decentralized infrastructure.

## Geolocation

Geographical data is sourced from a leading IP Geolocation provider, which maps IP addresses to corresponding countries.


This bar plot illustrates the distribution of observed beacon nodes across different countries, broken down for each major user agent.

## Cloud Providers


Cloud providers data is sourced from [Udger](https://udger.com/resources/datacenter-list), which maps IP addresses to known hosting providers.

### Cloud Hosting Rate

This line chart displays the count of beacon nodes within the Gnosis network that are hosted on known commercial cloud providers, compared to those that are not. It tracks the distribution over a specified period, offering insights into the infrastructure preferences for node hosting.

Regular analysis of this chart can reveal trends in the adoption of cloud services for beacon nodes. Such information is crucial for understanding the network's resilience and the potential reliance on cloud infrastructure.
