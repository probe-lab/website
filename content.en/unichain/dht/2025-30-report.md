# Unichain discv5 weekly report 2025-30

The following results show measurement data that were collected in calendar week **30** of **2025** from `2025-07-21` to `2025-07-28`.

[This page](../methodology) describes our methodology. Note that we are only able to display information about dialable nodes, hence nodes operating behind a NATs aren't accounted for, even though they may be interacting with the network.


## Geolocation

Geographical data is sourced from a leading IP Geolocation provider, which maps IP addresses to corresponding countries.


This bar plot illustrates the distribution of observed beacon nodes across different countries, broken down for each major user agent.

This plot displays the weekly geographical distribution of beacon nodes, categorized by country and broken down for each major user agent.

## Cloud Providers

This pie chart shows the average number of nodes over a day hosted on known cloud providers, compared to those that are not. 

Cloud providers data is powered by [ipregistry.co](https://ipregistry.co), which maps IP addresses to known hosting providers.

### Cloud Hosting Rate

This line chart displays the count of beacon nodes within the Unichain network that are hosted on known commercial cloud providers, compared to those that are not. It tracks the distribution over a specified period, offering insights into the infrastructure preferences for node hosting. The graph is broken down by each major user agent.

Regular analysis of this chart can reveal trends in the adoption of cloud services for beacon nodes. Such information is crucial for understanding the network's resilience and the potential reliance on cloud infrastructure.

### Cloud Provider Dependence

This bar chart presents the distribution of Unichain nodes among various cloud providers, including nodes not hosted within data centers (grouped under Non-Cloud).

{{< plotly json="https://cdn.probelab.io/plots/unichain_mainnet/2025/07/27/cloud_provider_avg_1d_plot.json" height="600px" >}}

This chart illustrates the trends in the distribution of all Unichain beacon nodes across cloud providers over the given time period. Nodes that cannot be classified with a cloud provider is labelled as "Non-
Cloud". Note that nodes hosted outside of data centers are not included in this representation.

## Protocols

This plot illustrates the evolving count of nodes supporting each of the listed protocols over time for the different user agents. The identification of supported protocols relies on the [libp2p identify protocol]&#40;https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/identify&#41;.

## Quic support

This stacked chart illustrates `quic` support for Unichain nodes over time, broken down by user agent.

## Sample Size

The following numbers show the sample size and other general statistics during the measurement period

- **Number of crawls: `82`**
  
  The number of crawls executed during the week indicated above.

- **Number of visits: `267794`**

  Every attempt to dial or connect to a peer counts as a visit. Regardless of errors that may occur. We visit peers many times during a given week to extract information from them or probe for their uptime. We visit all peers that we discover in the DHT and peers that we found to be still online from the previous week.

- **Number of unique addresses discovered in the DHT: `3264`**

  The total number of unique IP:Port combinations that our crawler learned about from other peers over the period of the given week and attempted to dial or connect to (visit). This is not the total number of Peer IDs that existed simultaneously in the network at any point during the week. It is the aggregate over the entire week.

- **Analysed chain ID: `130`**
  
  Only nodes that advertised the above OPStack chain id were considered in this analysis.

Timestamps are in UTC if not mentioned otherwise.
