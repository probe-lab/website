# Ethereum block broadcasting latency  

The following report represents a compilation of charts and metrics introducing the measured beacon block arrival times on the Ethereum network. The methodology will be available [here](../methodology) for further details.

ðŸ’¡ A more detailed report is available on [this ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/t/gossipsub-message-propagation-latency/19982) post.

_NOTE: dates of the data 14th to 16th of June (both included)_

## Block arrival time within the slot 
The line plot displays the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the block arrival times within the slot at the different clients (listed [here](../methodology#data-source)), showing each percentile per client type aggregating all the locations.

The following line plot shows the CDF of the block arrival time within the slot, aggregating all the data points by the continent that the clients were in.

## Block arrival time to block size correlation
The following heatmap shows the concentration block arrival times, aggregating the block size by a 50KB range. The displayed numbers correspond to the represented percentage of blocks falling into the block size and arrival time out of the total of blocks.

## Block arrival time over epochs
The line plot shows the maximum, minimum, mean and median values of the block arrival times aggregated over ranges of 4 epochs.   

_NOTE: The time aggregations are done over windows of 4 epochs (or 1536 seconds)_
