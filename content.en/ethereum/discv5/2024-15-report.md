# Ethereum discv5 weekly report 2024-15

The following results show measurement data that were collected in **calendar week** 15 **of** 2024 from `2024-04-08` to `2024-04-15`.

Our methodology is available [here](../methodology). Note we are only able to display information about dialable nodes, hence nodes operating behind a NAT aren't accounted for, even though they may be connected.

## Agents

### Agent Distribution

This bar chart represents the distribution of various user agents within the Ethereum `discv5` DHT. Each bar corresponds to a different user agent or client type and indicates its relative prevalence within the network for the given reporting period. The chart provides a snapshot of how different Ethereum clients are being utilized in the network's decentralized infrastructure.

## Cloud Providers

Cloud providers data is sourced from [Udger](https://udger.com/resources/datacenter-list), which maps IP addresses to known hosting providers.

### Cloud Hosting Rate

This line chart displays the count of beacon nodes within the Ethereum discv5 network that are hosted on known commercial cloud providers, compared to those that are not. It tracks the distribution over a specified period, offering insights into the infrastructure preferences for node hosting.

Regular analysis of this chart can reveal trends in the adoption of cloud services for beacon nodes. Such information is crucial for understanding the network's resilience and the potential reliance on cloud infrastructure.

This line chart illustrates the number of beacon nodes within the Ethereum discv5 network, hosted by recognized commercial cloud providers, broken down by each major user agent. It provides a user agent-specific view, mirroring the approach of the previously mentioned analysis, to highlight hosting preferences across different user agents.

{{< plotly json="https://cdn.probelab.io/legacy/2024/04/08/discv5-cloud-rate-agents.json" height="600px" >}}

This bar chart presents the weekly distribution of Ethereum beacon nodes among various cloud providers, including nodes not hosted within data centers (grouped under _Non-Datacenter_).

## Stale Node Records

### All `discv5` peers

This stacked plot depicts the count of node records stored within each node's routing table and made accessible through the DHT. These node records serve as a mechanism through which nodes discover new remote nodes in the network.

Ensuring the reachability of referenced nodes shared within the network holds paramount importance. The plot delineates the occurrences of reachable and non-reachable (stale) node records. Note that nodes running behind a NAT are counted as unreachable even though they may be online.

For instance, if a node's record is present in the routing tables of 100 other nodes and the node is reachable, the plot will reflect an increase of 100 in the _online_ category.

This plot displays data about all nodes participating in `discv5` and isn't limited to Ethereum mainnet nodes.

### Ethereum mainnet

This plot is similar to the above but only displays the number of Ethereum mainnet (Deneb) records found in the routing table of other Ethereum mainnet (Deneb) nodes.

## Protocols

This plot illustrates the evolving count of nodes supporting each of the listed protocols over time. It exclusively presents data gathered from nodes accessible through a libp2p connection via our crawler. The identification of supported protocols relies on the [libp2p identify protocol](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/identify), hence necessitating a libp2p connection for discovery.
