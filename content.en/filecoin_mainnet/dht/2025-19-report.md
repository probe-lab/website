# Filecoin Report Cal. Week 19 - 2025

## General Information

The following results show measurement data that were collected in **calendar week** 19 **of** 2025 from `2025-05-05` to `2025-05-12`.

Our methodology is available [here](../methodology). Note we are only able to display information about dialable peers, hence nodes operating behind a NAT aren't accounted for, even though they may be connected.


## Agents

This bar chart represents the distribution of various user agents within the Filecoin Mainnet DHT. Each bar corresponds to a different user agent or client type and indicates its relative prevalence within the network for the given reporting period. The chart provides a snapshot of how different Filecoin Mainnet clients are being utilized in the network's decentralized infrastructure.

The bar labeled `Unknown` represents the count of nodes that we confirmed to be online but couldn't retrieve the agent version information from. This situation can occur due to various reasons, such as the node terminating the connection before completing the full protocol negotiation. In this case, despite reaching an advanced stage in the process, we were unable to obtain any information about the node's configuration.

## Cloud Providers

This pie chart shows the average number of nodes over a day hosted on known cloud providers, compared to those that are not. 

Cloud providers data is powered by [ipregistry.co](https://ipregistry.co), which maps IP addresses to known hosting providers.

### Cloud Hosting Rate

This line chart displays the count of Filecoin mainnet peers that are hosted on known commercial cloud providers, compared to those that are not. It tracks the distribution over a specified period, offering insights into the infrastructure preferences for node hosting. The graph is broken down by each major user agent.

Regular analysis of this chart can reveal trends in the adoption of cloud services for beacon nodes. Such information is crucial for understanding the network's resilience and the potential reliance on cloud infrastructure.

### Cloud Provider Dependence

This bar chart presents the distribution of Filecoin mainnet peers among various cloud providers, including nodes not hosted within data centers (grouped under Non-Cloud).

{{< plotly json="https://cdn.probelab.io/plots/filecoin_mainnet/2025/05/11/cloud_provider_avg_1d_plot.json" height="600px" >}}

This chart illustrates the trends in the distribution of all Filecoin mainnet peers across cloud providers over the given time period. Nodes that cannot be classified with a cloud provider is labelled as "Non-
Cloud". Note that nodes hosted outside of data centers are not included in this representation.

## Churn Analysis

This plot presents the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of peer departure
times from the network over a measurement period of one-week. The plot
basically shows the percentage of nodes online at a point in time (`t=0`) that
will have disconnected after 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, .. up to 24 hours after `t=0`.

- **X-Axis (Time in Hours)**: Represents the elapsed time since the reference
point (`t=0`), measured in hours.
- **Y-Axis (Percentage of Offline Peers)**: Indicates the cumulative
percentage of peers that have disconnected from the network by the
corresponding time interval. Specifically, it shows the proportion of peers
that were online at `t=0` and have since gone offline.

This visualization aids in understanding peer churn dynamics, which is crucial
for optimizing network stability, resource allocation, and improving overall
decentralized network performance.

Note that the sum of the CDF is **NOT** 100%, as it only includes peers that were
online for up to 24h.

### Errors

The next plot showcases the percentage of errors encountered when connecting to peers during crawling activities, relative to the total number of connection attempts.
By tracking various error types over time, it provides insights into crawling reliability and highlights trends in connection issues.

This plot displays the percentage of errors encountered when requesting peers from a remote node's routing table after establishing a connection.
It offers insights into the reliability of DHT requests within active libp2p connections.

## Stale Peer Records

This stacked plot depicts the count of peer records stored within each node's routing table and made accessible through the DHT.
These peer records are used to discover new remote peers within the network, enabling efficient and secure routing towards the target peer or content

Ensuring the reachability of referenced peers shared within the network holds paramount importance. The plot delineates the occurrences of reachable and non-reachable (stale) peer records. Note that nodes running behind a NAT are counted as unreachable even though they may be online.

For instance, if a peer's record is present in the routing tables of 100 other nodes and the peer is reachable, the plot will reflect an increase of 100 in the _online_ category.

## Sample Size

The following numbers show the sample size and other general statistics during the measurement period

- **Number of crawls: `84`**
  
  The number of crawls executed during the week indicated above.

- **Number of visits: `82862`**

  Every attempt to dial or connect to a peer counts as a visit. Regardless of errors that may occur. We visit peers many times during a given week to extract information from them or probe for their uptime. We visit all peers that we discover in the DHT and peers that we found to be still online from the previous week.

- **Number of unique addresses discovered in the DHT: `0`**

  The total number of unique IP:Port combinations that our crawler learned about from other peers over the period of the given week and attempted to dial or connect to (visit). This is not the total number of Peer IDs that existed simultaneously in the network at any point during the week. It is the aggregate over the entire week.

Timestamps are in UTC if not mentioned otherwise.


- Number of crawls `84`
- Number of visits `82862`
  > Visiting a peer means dialing or connecting to it. Every time the crawler or monitoring process tries to dial or connect to a peer we consider this as _visiting_ it. Regardless of errors that may occur.
